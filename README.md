# How to use python
1. Download the Anaconda Distribution which contains all the data science packages that you will need. [here!](https://www.anaconda.com)
2. Download Sublime text which is a lightweight text editor that will allow you to easily build your code. [here!](https://www.sublimetext.com)
3. Install the Conda plugin for sublime text. Follow the procedure [here!](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/sublime/)
4. Write some code!
